/*
			GOROUTINES
			----------
- How do goroutines actually work?
- Are they OS threads?
- Green threads?
- How many can we create?

--> Goroutines are unique to Go are their deep integration with Go's runtime
--> They are not OS threads & they are not exactly green threads
--> Coroutines and goroutines
--> Go's mechanism for hosting goroutines is an implementation of whatâ€™s called
	an M:N scheduler, which means it maps M green threads to N OS threads.
--> Go follows a model of concurrency called the fork-join model.
