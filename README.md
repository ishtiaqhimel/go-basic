## Why learn Go Programming?
- **Easy to learn**: Go has neat programming syntax that is easier to understand.
- **Scalability**: Go can stack the sizes of a program to grow and shrink. So the application developed in Go programming can be very scalable as the memory is accurately utilized.
- **Focused vocabulary**: The number of keywords is less than other languages. It has around 25 keywords so developers don't need to remember a lot of the keywords.
- **Handy standard libraries**: Go has many standard libraries which makes it a lot easier to write programs.
